# **Hotel Management System**

This project is focused on developing a Hotel Management System using Python and SQL. The system is designed to manage hotel operations efficiently, including customer booking, room management, billing, and staff records. By integrating Python for the application logic and SQL for database management, the project provides a user-friendly and reliable solution for handling day-to-day hotel activities.

## Project Overview
### Problem Statement

Managing hotel operations manually can be inefficient and error-prone. Tasks like room reservations, customer details, billing, and staff management require accuracy and consistency. The goal of this project is to build an automated system that improves operational efficiency and minimizes errors.

### Solution

A Python-based application is developed to provide a user interface for hotel staff and administrators, while SQL is used for managing and querying hotel databases. The system automates room booking, generates invoices, manages customer and staff records, and ensures smooth hotel operations.

### Stages of the Project

### Database Design & Setup

SQL database designed with tables for customers, rooms, bookings, billing, and staff.

Relationships established between tables for easy data access.

### Data Management

Customer registration and details stored securely in the database.

Room allocation and availability tracking.

Staff details management for administrative purposes.

### Application Development (Python)

A Python-based interface to interact with the SQL database.

Functions implemented for booking rooms, generating invoices, and updating records.

Error handling to ensure data consistency and prevent invalid operations.

### Core Features

Login and Logout Feature: To ensure user authetication.

Customer Management: Add, update, and delete customer details.

Room Management: Track room availability and reservations.

Booking System: Reserve rooms and generate booking confirmations.

Billing System: Generate bills automatically based on stay duration and services.

Staff Records: Maintain staff details and update them when required.

Reports: Generate detailed reports on bookings, revenue, and customer activity.

### Evaluation & Testing

Tested with sample booking scenarios.

Ensured correct updates in SQL database after every transaction.

### Technologies and Tools Used

Programming Language: Python

Database: MySQL / SQLite (depending on setup)

Libraries:

mysql.connector or sqlite3 – for database connectivity

pandas – for structured data handling (optional)

tkinter – for GUI (if graphical interface implemented)

### Key Features

Automates hotel operations with reliable database management.

Real-time room availability tracking.

Secure storage of customer and staff details.

Automated bill generation and booking confirmation.

Scalable design to support more features like restaurant services or online booking.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python and SQL can be combined to build a practical Hotel Management System. By automating bookings, billing, and record-keeping, the system reduces manual effort and increases efficiency. The modular design makes it extendable to include advanced features like payment gateways, online reservations, or reporting dashboards.
